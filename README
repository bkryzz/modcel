  MODLOG treats a population of cells which evolve
  according to a set of Markovian rules. The following
  characters decribe the cell population:

  Discrete: model an assembly of individual cells

  Multistate: each cell evolves through discrete states,
  from “healthy” to “dead”

  Damage: each cell has a number of tags describing the 
  accumulation of individual defects (e.g., SSB, DSB, 
  base-excision, base-polymerization etc.)
***** In V1.0 only SSB and DSB are implemented

  Repair: each cell has an individual probability for 
  repairing the different defects

  Inheritance: each cell has an individual probability 
  for duplication, the two sister cells inherit the DNA 
  of the mother cell

  Geometry & topology: each cell in the model occupies a
  site of a regular lattice and “knows” its connectivity 
  to neighbor cells, allowing distributed effects
***** In V1.0 only 2D is implemented with diamond sym

  Chemistry: reaction-diffusion equations describing the 
  flux of chemicals can be coupled to the spatial matrix 
***** In V1.0 only one tracer 2D field is implemented

BUILD AND COMPILE

The main directory contains this README file, a ./source
folder, a generic Makefile and a sample input file. 
Little modification is needed for the Makefile, usually
only the fortran compiler needs to be updated for your 
local machine.

Once the 'make' command is issued in the main directory
compilation starts. 
Two executable files are created in the main directory:

- modlog, the executable code

- modmin, an utility to convert xyz files 

RUNNING THE CODE

modlog looks for an input file named 'input' in the same
directory from which it is launched. the sample input
provided should be enough self-explanatory.
